  Use Commanded to build your own Elixir applications following the CQRS/ES pattern.

  Provides support for:

  - [Defining applications](application.html).
  - [Command registration and dispatch](commands.html).
  - [Hosting and delegation to aggregates](aggregates.html).
  - [Event handling](events.html).
  - [Long running process managers](process-managers.html).

  Use Commanded with one of the following event stores for persistence:

  - Elixir [EventStore](https://hex.pm/packages/eventstore) using Postgres for persistence
  - [EventStoreDB](https://www.eventstore.com/)

  Please check the [Getting Started](getting-started.html) and [Usage](usage.html) guides to learn more.

  Retrieving aggregate state is done by calling to the opened aggregate,

  @moduledoc """
  Defines a Commanded application.

  The application expects at least an `:otp_app` option to be specified. It
  should point to an OTP application that has the application configuration.

  For example, the application:

      defmodule MyApp.Application do
        use Commanded.Application, otp_app: :my_app

        router(MyApp.Router)
      end

  Could be configured with:

      # config/config.exs
      config :my_app, MyApp.Application
        event_store: [
          adapter: Commanded.EventStore.Adapters.EventStore,
          event_store: MyApp.EventStore
        ],
        pubsub: :local,
        registry: :local

  Alternatively, you can include the configuration when defining the
  application:

      defmodule MyApp.Application do
        use Commanded.Application,
          otp_app: :my_app,
          event_store: [
            adapter: Commanded.EventStore.Adapters.EventStore,
            event_store: MyApp.EventStore
          ],
          pubsub: :local,
          registry: :local

        router(MyApp.Router)
      end

  A Commanded application must be started before it can be used:

      {:ok, _pid} = MyApp.Application.start_link()

  Instead of starting the application manually, you should use a
  [Supervisor](supervision.html).

  ## Supervision

  Use a supervisor to start your Commanded application:

      Supervisor.start_link([
        MyApp.Application
      ], strategy: :one_for_one)

  ## Command routing

  Commanded applications are also composite routers allowing you to include
  one or more routers within an application.

  ### Example

      defmodule MyApp.Application do
        use Commanded.Application, otp_app: :my_app

        router(MyApp.Accounts.Router)
        router(MyApp.Billing.Router)
        router(MyApp.Notifications.Router)
      end

  See `Commanded.Commands.CompositeRouter` for details.

  ## Command dispatch

  Once a router has been configured you can dispatch a command via the
  application:

      :ok = MyApp.dispatch(command, opts)

  See `c:dispatch/1` and `c:dispatch/2` for details.

  ## Dynamic named applications

  An application can be provided with a name as an option to `start_link/1`.
  This can be used to start the same application multiple times, each using its
  own separately configured and isolated event store. Each application must be
  started with a unique name.

  Multiple instances of the same event handler or process manager can be
  started by referring to a started application by its name. The event store
  operations can also be scoped to an application by referring to its name.

  ### Example

  Start an application process for each tenant in a multi-tenanted app,
  guaranteeing that the data and processing remains isolated between tenants.

      for tenant <- [:tenant1, :tenant2, :tenant3] do
        {:ok, _app} = MyApp.Application.start_link(name: tenant)
      end

  Typically you would start the applications using a supervisor:

      children =
        for tenant <- [:tenant1, :tenant2, :tenant3] do
          {MyApp.Application, name: tenant}
        end

      Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)

  To dispatch a command you must provide the application name:

      :ok = MyApp.Application.dispatch(command, application: :tenant1)

  ## Default dispatch options

  An application can be configured with default command dispatch options such as
  `:consistency`, `:timeout`, and `:returning`. Any defaults will be used
  unless overridden by options provided to the dispatch function.

      defmodule MyApp.Application do
        use Commanded.Application,
          otp_app: :my_app,
          default_dispatch_opts: [
            consistency: :eventual,
            returning: :aggregate_version
          ]
      end

  See the `Commanded.Commands.Router` module for more details about the
  supported options.

    - `timeout_or_opts` is either an integer timeout or a keyword list of
      options.

      The timeout must be an integer greater than zero which specifies how many
      milliseconds to allow the command to be handled, or the atom `:infinity`
      to wait indefinitely. The default timeout value is five seconds.

      Alternatively, an options keyword list can be provided, it supports the
      following options.

      Options:

        - `causation_id` - an optional UUID used to identify the cause of the
          command being dispatched.

        - `correlation_id` - an optional UUID used to correlate related
          commands/events together.

        - `consistency` - to choose the consistency guarantee of the command dispatch.

          The available options are:

          - `:eventual` (default) - a successful command dispatch will return immediately.

          - `:strong` - a successful command dispatch will block until all strongly
            consistent event handlers and process managers have handled all events created by the command.

          - An explicit list of event handler and process manager modules (or their configured names),
            containing only those handlers you'd like to wait for. No other handlers will be awaited on,
            regardless of their own configured consistency setting.
            e.g. `[ExampleHandler, AnotherHandler]` or `["ExampleHandler", "AnotherHandler"]`

        - `metadata` - an optional map containing key/value pairs comprising
          the metadata to be associated with all events created by the
          command.

        - `returning` - to choose what response is returned from a successful
            command dispatch. The default is to return an `:ok`.

            The available options are:

            - `:aggregate_state` - to return the update aggregate state in the
              successful response: `{:ok, aggregate_state}`.

            - `:aggregate_version` - to include the aggregate stream version
              in the successful response: `{:ok, aggregate_version}`.

            - `:execution_result` - to return a `Commanded.Commands.ExecutionResult`
              struct containing the aggregate's identity, version, and any
              events produced from the command along with their associated
              metadata.

            - `false` - don't return anything except an `:ok`.

        - `timeout` - as described above.

  Returns `:ok` on success unless the `:returning` option is specified where
  it returns one of `{:ok, aggregate_state}`, `{:ok, aggregate_version}`, or
  `{:ok, %Commanded.Commands.ExecutionResult{}}`.

  Returns `{:error, reason}` on failure.

defmodule Commanded.Middleware.Pipeline do
  @moduledoc """
  Pipeline is a struct used as an argument in the callback functions of modules
  implementing the `Commanded.Middleware` behaviour.

  This struct must be returned by each function to be used in the next
  middleware based on the configured middleware chain.

  ## Pipeline fields

    - `application` - the Commanded application.

    - `assigns` - shared user data as a map.

    - `causation_id` - an optional UUID used to identify the cause of the
       command being dispatched.

    - `correlation_id` - an optional UUID used to correlate related
       commands/events together.

    - `command` - command struct being dispatched.

    - `command_uuid` - UUID assigned to the command being dispatched.

    - `consistency` - requested dispatch consistency, either: `:eventual`
       (default) or `:strong`.

    - `halted` - flag indicating whether the pipeline was halted.

    - `identity` - an atom specifying a field in the command containing the
       aggregate's identity or a one-arity function that returns an identity
       from the command being dispatched.

    - `identity_prefix` - an optional prefix to the aggregate's identity. It may
       be a string (e.g. "prefix-") or a zero arity function
       (e.g. `&MyRouter.identity_prefix/0`).

    - `metadata` - the metadata map to be persisted along with the events.

    - `response` - sets the response to send back to the caller.

  Create a persistent subscription to an event stream.

  To subscribe to all events appended to any stream use `:all` as the stream
  when subscribing.

  The event store will remember the subscribers last acknowledged event.
  Restarting the named subscription will resume from the next event following
  the last seen.

  Once subscribed, the subscriber process should be sent a
  `{:subscribed, subscription}` message to allow it to defer initialisation
  until the subscription has started.

  The subscriber process will be sent all events persisted to any stream. It
  will receive a `{:events, events}` message for each batch of events persisted
  for a single aggregate.

  The subscriber must ack each received, and successfully processed event, using
  `Commanded.EventStore.ack_event/3`.
